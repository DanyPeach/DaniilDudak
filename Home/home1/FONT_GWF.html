    <h1>"Replay"</h1>

    <p class="verse">Am I, am I, am I
        Am I, am I, am I
        
        Am I still alive? Where am I? I cry
        Who was it that pulled the trigger, was it you or I?
        I'm completely numb, why you acting dumb?
        I won't blame myself 'cause we both know you were the one
    </p>
        
    <p class="chorus">I don't know what to do, you don't know what to say
        The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay
        The monster inside you is torturing me
        The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh
        
        Replay, r-replay, eh-eh
        The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh
    </p>
        
    <p class="verse">Every single day, yeah, I dig a grave
        Then I sit inside it, wondering if I'll behave
        It's a game I play, and I hate to say
        You're the worst thing and the best thing that's happened to me
    </p>
        
    <p class="chorus">I don't know what to do, you don't know what to say
        The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay
        The monster inside you is torturing me
        The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh
        
        Replay, r-replay, eh-eh
        The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh
    </p>
        
    <p class="verse">Psychologically, it's something that I can't explain
        Scratch my nails into the dirt to pull me out okay
        Does it matter, does it matter? Damage is done
        Does it matter, does it matter? You had the gun
        You had the gun
        You had the gun
        You had the gun
    </p>
        
    <p class="chorus"> I don't know what to do, you don't know what to say
        The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay
        The monster inside you is torturing me
        The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh
        
        Your monsters torture me
        Your monsters torture me
        Your monsters torture me
        The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh
    </p>
